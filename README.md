# M1_CALCULATOR_UTILITY


# Description

IT IS A BASIC CALCULATOR FOR NORMAL USE.
WHICH CONTAINS DIFFERENT FEATURE FOR DIFFERENT OPERATION.
IN THIS CALCULATOR YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH KIND OF CALCULATOR YOU WANT TO USE.

# High Level Requirment

You Have Different feature you can choose with
If want calculate you compound interest or simple interest or simple calculator function
User Will be able to do these things without any complexity.

# Low level requirment

user can enter desire data.

Statement of evere line should be clear.

So user can understand each Statement and give input according to Statement.

Calculator Should not give wrong output.
