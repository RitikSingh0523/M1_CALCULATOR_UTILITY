# M1_CALCULATOR_UTILITY


# Description

IT IS A BASIC CALCULATOR FOR NORMAL USE.
WHICH CONTAINS DIFFERENT FEATURE FOR DIFFERENT OPERATION.
IN THIS CALCULATOR YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH KIND OF CALCULATOR YOU WANT TO USE.

# High Level Requirment

You Have Different feature you can choose with
If want calculate you compound interest or simple interest or simple calculator function
User Will be able to do these things without any complexity.

# Low level requirment

user can enter desire data.

Statement of evere line should be clear.

So user can understand each Statement and give input according to Statement.

Calculator Should not give wrong output.

switch
case(1)
choice 1;
(call function)
case(2)

default;


@ call first function

declear functions
inputData = Read_Input()
if operator = "+" result = firstNumber + secondNumber

else if operator = "-" result = firstNumber - secondNumber

else if operator = "*" result = firstNumber * secondNumber

else if operator = "/" result = firstNumber / secondNumber

return result

@call secound function

declear functions
inputData = Read_Input()

compound interest=p(1+(r/n))^t

return result;

@call third function

# Installlation

First Install IDE for c Language.
Suggation- Use VS code
Install C Extention


# Run in Windows

Use vs complie to run the code

# Run in ubuntu

Run command gcc filename.c to complie

Run command gcc filename.c -o output-filename to create output file

Run command ./output-filename to run command

# Expected Behaviour 


##### First it will ask you to select a input for selecting a type of calculator.
##### After Selecting it will ask for choose differnt action that you can choose from.
##### If you select Simple Calculator you have option to choose +,-,*,'/',^,!.
##### If you select Simple Interest you have to fill detail about Amount time and rate.
##### If you select Compound Interest you have to fill detail about Amount time and rate.
